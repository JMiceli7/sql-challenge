# sql-challenge

This repo contains files to the Module 9 SQL documents

In the EmployeeSQL folder you find a Data folder, 3 .sql files, and 1 ERD .png file

This module assignments simulates a research project that requires sorting through company files to generate information on employees during the 1980s and 1990s

The Data folder contains 6 .csv files of various types of employee information 

The ERD picture is a picture of an ERD diagram made with QuickDBD. I sketched this diagram and set up Primary and Foreign keys between the tables to show their connectinos

The SQL files include one with only table schemata, generated from QuickDBD ERD aforementioned, one with only search queries, and one copy with both table schemata and search queries. The aforementioned .csv files were loaded into the tables created with the schemata

The queries include various information requests about the target employee files. Copies of these questions have been added to the .sql files above the operations
